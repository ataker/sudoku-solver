// so here's my first thought
// return an array that looks like an inverse of the numVals
// numVals is current filled in squares with empty squares as 0
// return array with [0] as filled out and array of possibilities

const POSSIBLE_NUMBERS = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];

export default function checkRow ({numVals}:{numVals:number[]}) {
  // get difference between possible answers and what was sent in
  const rr = numVals
}
